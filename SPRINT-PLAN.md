2. VS Code extension health monitoring
3. Basic capability testing framework
4. Tool availability status tracking

### **Critical Path (Phase 2)**
1. Task classification and routing logic
2. MCP connector with error handling and retries
3. VS Code Extension API integration patterns
4. User preference storage and learning

### **User-Facing (Phase 3)**

2. Routing decision transparency
3. Configuration override capabilities
4. Status and progress indicators

### **Advanced (Phase 4)**
1. Multi-agent task coordination
2. Intelligent conflict resolution
3. Workflow automation templates
4. Performance-based route optimization

## **Success Metrics**

### Phase-by-Phase Goals:
- **Phase 1**: Successfully discover and monitor 3+ AI tools (Claude MCP, Copilot, Amazon Q)
- **Phase 2**: Route 5+ task types with 90%+ routing accuracy
- **Phase 3**: Complete user workflows with <5 clicks for common tasks
- **Phase 4**: Handle multi-tool workflows with <10% conflict resolution needed

### Technical Milestones:
- **Foundation**: Tool discovery working across MCP, Extensions, CLI
- **Core**: Adaptive routing with fallback strategies operational
- **UX**: Transparent orchestration with user control
- **Advanced**: Multi-agent workflows with conflict resolution

## **Architecture Alignment**

This sprint plan directly implements the core architecture concepts:

### **Four-Layer Architecture Implementation**
1. **Dynamic Tool Discovery Engine** → Phase 1 deliverables
2. **Adaptive Task Router** → Phase 2 core focus
3. **Hybrid Integration Layer** → Phase 2 connector framework
4. **Orchestration Core** → Phase 4 advanced features

### **Design Principles Adherence**
- **Tool Agnosticism**: Discovery works with any AI tool combination
- **Hybrid Integration**: Support for MCP, Extensions, CLI, APIs
- **Real-time Adaptation**: Health monitoring and dynamic routing
- **Capability-based Routing**: Test actual vs assumed capabilities

---

## **Risk Mitigation**

### **Phase 1 Risks**
- **MCP Protocol Changes**: Use versioned protocol implementation
- **Tool API Instability**: Implement robust error handling and fallbacks

### **Phase 2 Risks**
- **Routing Complexity**: Start with simple heuristics, evolve to ML
- **Integration Reliability**: Comprehensive connector testing with mocks

### **Phase 3 Risks**
- **UI Complexity**: Focus on essential workflows first
- **User Adoption**: Provide clear value demonstration and onboarding

### **Phase 4 Risks**
- **Conflict Resolution Accuracy**: Build conservative resolution with user override
- **Performance Impact**: Implement caching and background processing

## **Post-Sprint Roadmap Connection**

This 4-phase sprint plan directly feeds into the broader roadmap:

- **Phases 1-2** → Complete "Phase 1-2: Foundation & Core AI Orchestration" from roadmap
- **Phases 3-4** → Enable "Phase 3: Enhanced AI Coordination" features
- **Success Metrics** → Establish baseline for "Phase 4: Beyond AI - Traditional Tools"

The sprint deliverables create the foundation for the full vision of transforming VS Code into an adaptive multi-agent development environment.

**Created**: `date`
**Status**: Ready for implementation
**Next Review**: After Phase 1 completion

This sprint plan builds incrementally from basic discovery through full orchestration capabilities, following the established architecture patterns while focusing on practical deliverables that demonstrate the adaptive multi-agent development environment vision.
