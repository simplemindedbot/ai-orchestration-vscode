# AI Orchestration User Guide

Welcome to the AI Orchestration system for VS Code! This guide will help you understand and use the multi-agent development environment.

## Overview

The AI Orchestration system transforms your VS Code into an intelligent development hub that automatically coordinates multiple AI assistants to help with your coding tasks. Instead of manually switching between different AI tools, the system intelligently routes tasks to the most appropriate AI assistant based on what you're trying to accomplish.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Install the AI Orchestration extension from the VS Code marketplace
2. The system will automatically discover available AI tools on your system
3. Configure your preferences (optional - the system works with intelligent defaults)

### First Time Setup

When you first launch the extension, it will:

1. **Scan for AI Tools**: Automatically discover GitHub Copilot, Claude MCP servers, AWS Toolkit, and other AI assistants
2. **Test Capabilities**: Verify what each tool can actually do
3. **Show Discovery Results**: Present what was found and their capabilities

## Core Concepts

### Dynamic Discovery

The system automatically finds and configures AI tools on your system:

- **üß© VS Code Extensions**: GitHub Copilot, Amazon Q, Continue, Codeium, etc.
- **üîå MCP Servers**: Claude Code, custom domain tools
- **üíª CLI Tools**: Gemini CLI, cursor CLI, specialized command-line tools
- **üåê API Services**: Direct connections to AI services

### Intelligent Routing

When you make a request, the system analyzes it and routes to the best available tool:

- **Planning tasks** ‚Üí Claude MCP (architecture, design)
- **Code completion** ‚Üí GitHub Copilot (inline suggestions)
- **AWS deployment** ‚Üí Amazon Q (cloud expertise)
- **Large codebase analysis** ‚Üí Gemini CLI (large context)

### Adaptive Behavior

The system adapts in real-time:
- If a preferred tool is unavailable, automatically uses alternatives
- Learns from your preferences and feedback
- Monitors tool health and adjusts routing accordingly

## Configuration

### Discovery Settings

Control which tools the system looks for:

```json
{
  "aiOrchestration.discovery": {
    "enableAutoDiscovery": true,
    "scanPorts": [3001, 3002, 3003, 8080],
    "extensionWhitelist": ["GitHub.copilot", "AmazonWebServices.aws-toolkit-vscode"],
    "discoveryInterval": 300000
  }
}
```

### Routing Preferences

Customize how tasks are routed:

```json
{
  "aiOrchestration.routing": {
    "preferredTools": {
      "planning": ["claude", "gemini"],
      "completion": ["copilot", "codeium"],
      "deployment": ["amazon-q", "claude"]
    },
    "fallbackBehavior": "graceful",
    "parallelismLevel": "aggressive"
  }
}
```

### User Experience

Control interface and behavior:

```json
{
  "aiOrchestration.user": {
    "allowFallbacks": true,
    "requireConfirmation": false,
    "showRoutingExplanations": true,
    "autoAcceptSingleTool": true
  }
}
```

## Understanding Routing Decisions

### Routing Explanations

When routing explanations are enabled, you'll see clear information about orchestration decisions:

```
Task: "Implement user authentication"
Primary Tool: Claude MCP
Reason: Best suited for architectural planning and multi-file implementation
Supporting: GitHub Copilot (code completion), Amazon Q (AWS integration)
Degraded Mode: No (all preferred tools available)
```

### Tool Selection Factors

The system considers:
- **Capability Match**: How well the tool's abilities fit the task
- **User Preferences**: Your historical choices and explicit preferences
- **Performance History**: Response time and quality metrics
- **Context Relevance**: Project type, languages, frameworks used
- **Tool Health**: Current availability and responsiveness

### Manual Override

You can always override orchestration decisions:
- Click "Choose Different Tools" in routing explanations
- Use tool-specific commands when you want direct control
- Set persistent preferences for specific task types

## Troubleshooting
