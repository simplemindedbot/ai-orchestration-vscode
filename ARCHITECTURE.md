- **MCP Servers**: Probes common ports and reads configuration files
- **CLI Tools**: Tests for available command-line AI tools
- **API Services**: Discovers available AI APIs through configuration

### 2. Adaptive Task Router

**Purpose**: Intelligently route tasks to the most appropriate available tools.

**Key Classes**:
- `AdaptiveTaskRouter` - Main routing logic
- `RoutingPlan` - Execution plan with primary/supporting tools
- `TaskAssignment` - Tool assignments for specific tasks

**Routing Factors**:
- Tool availability and health status
- Capability fitness for the specific task
- User preferences and historical choices
- Performance metrics and response times

### 3. Hybrid Integration Layer

**Purpose**: Provide unified interface for diverse tool integration methods.

**Abstract Base**: `ToolConnector`

**Concrete Implementations**:
- `MCPConnector` - Model Context Protocol servers
- `VSCodeExtensionConnector` - VS Code extension APIs
- `CLIConnector` - Command-line tool execution
- `APIConnector` - Direct REST API calls

### 4. Orchestration Core

**Purpose**: Coordinate multi-agent task execution and conflict resolution.

**Key Classes**:
- `AIOrchestrator` - Main orchestration controller
- `ConflictResolver` - Handles conflicting suggestions
- `IntegrationEngine` - Merges results from multiple tools

## Data Flow Architecture

```
User Request → Task Analysis → Tool Discovery → Routing Plan → Parallel Execution → Conflict Resolution → Integrated Response
```

### Detailed Flow:

1. **Request Processing**
   - Parse user intent and extract task parameters
   - Classify task type (completion, planning, analysis, etc.)
   - Determine required capabilities and constraints

2. **Dynamic Discovery**
   - Check current tool availability and health
   - Update capability matrix if tools have changed
   - Assess tool fitness for the specific request

3. **Adaptive Routing**
   - Generate routing plan with primary and supporting tools
   - Apply user preferences and performance history
   - Create fallback strategies for tool failures

4. **Parallel Execution**
   - Execute tasks on multiple tools simultaneously where possible
   - Monitor execution progress and tool health
   - Handle timeout and error scenarios gracefully

5. **Integration**
   - Resolve conflicts between different tool responses
   - Merge complementary results into unified output
   - Apply consistency filters and style normalization

## Integration Protocols

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)

**Use Cases**: Claude Code MCP, custom domain tools, future MCP-enabled assistants

**Connection Method**:
```typescript
const client = new MCPClient(endpoint);
await client.initialize();
const response = await client.request({
  method: 'tools/call',
  params: { name: 'generate', arguments: taskData }
});
```

### VS Code Extension API

**Use Cases**: GitHub Copilot, Amazon Q, Continue, Codeium

**Connection Method**:
```typescript
const extension = vscode.extensions.getExtension('GitHub.copilot');
await vscode.commands.executeCommand('editor.action.inlineSuggest.trigger');
```

### CLI Integration

**Use Cases**: Gemini CLI, Cursor CLI, specialized command-line tools

**Connection Method**:
```typescript
const process = spawn(command, args);
// Handle stdout/stderr and process lifecycle
```

### Direct API

**Use Cases**: Anthropic API, OpenAI API, Google AI API, specialized services

**Connection Method**:
```typescript
const response = await fetch(apiEndpoint, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}` },
  body: JSON.stringify(requestData)
});
```

## Configuration System

### Discovery Configuration
```typescript
interface DiscoveryConfig {
  enableAutoDiscovery: boolean;
  scanPorts: number[];           // MCP server ports to check
  extensionWhitelist: string[];  // Allowed extension IDs
  mcpConfigPaths: string[];      // Configuration file locations
  discoveryInterval: number;     // How often to rediscover (ms)
}
```

### Routing Configuration
```typescript
interface RoutingConfig {
  preferredTools: Record<string, string[]>; // task type -> preferred tools
  fallbackBehavior: 'graceful' | 'fail-fast';
  parallelismLevel: 'conservative' | 'aggressive';
  maxConcurrentTasks: number;
}
```

### User Preferences
```typescript
interface UserConfig {
  allowFallbacks: boolean;
  requireConfirmation: boolean;
  showRoutingExplanations: boolean;
  toolPriorities: Record<string, number>;
}
```

## Health Monitoring and Adaptation

### Real-time Health Checks
- Periodic ping/health check requests to all discovered tools
- Automatic removal of unhealthy tools from routing consideration
- Recovery detection and tool re-enablement

### Performance Monitoring
- Track response times and success rates per tool
- Monitor user satisfaction and task completion rates
- Adapt routing preferences based on performance metrics

### Failure Handling
- Graceful degradation when tools become unavailable
- Automatic failover to backup tools
- User notification of significant capability changes

## Security Considerations

### Tool Isolation
- Each tool connector runs in isolated context
- No cross-tool data sharing without explicit user consent
- Audit logging of all tool interactions

### Authentication Management
- Secure storage of API keys and credentials
- Per-tool authentication with minimal privilege principles
- Support for enterprise SSO and authentication schemes

### Data Privacy
- Tool-specific data retention policies
- User control over data sharing between tools
- Compliance with enterprise data governance requirements

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategies
- Capability discovery results cached with TTL
- Tool health status cached to reduce check frequency
- Response caching for repeated similar requests

### Parallel Execution
- Concurrent tool invocation where tasks are independent
- Streaming responses for long-running operations
- Progressive result display as tools complete

### Resource Management
- Connection pooling for frequently used tools
- Rate limiting compliance for API-based tools
- Memory and CPU usage monitoring

## Extension Points

### Custom Tool Integration
```typescript
interface CustomToolConnector extends ToolConnector {
  // Implement discovery, connection, and invocation methods
  // Register with the discovery engine
}
```

### Workflow Templates
```typescript
interface WorkflowTemplate {
  name: string;
  taskSequence: Task[];
  toolPreferences: ToolPreference[];
  conditionalLogic: RoutingCondition[];
}
```

### Plugin Architecture
- Support for third-party orchestration plugins
- Custom routing strategies and conflict resolution
- Domain-specific workflow extensions

## Scalability Considerations

### Multi-Workspace Support
- Separate tool discovery per workspace
- Workspace-specific configuration inheritance
- Cross-workspace tool sharing capabilities

### Team Collaboration
- Shared tool configuration and preferences
- Collaborative conflict resolution
- Team performance analytics and optimization

### Enterprise Integration
- Central tool management and deployment
- Policy-based routing and tool restrictions
- Integration with enterprise AI governance frameworks
