# AI Orchestration for VS Code

**Adaptive Multi-Agent Development Environment Architecture**

This repository contains the design and proof-of-concept implementation for an AI orchestration system that transforms VS Code into an adaptive multi-agent development environment.

## 🎯 Vision

Transform every VS Code instance into a personalized, adaptive AI development command center that automatically discovers, coordinates, and optimizes whatever AI tools the developer chooses to use - creating a development experience that's more than the sum of its parts.

## 🚀 Key Innovations

### Dynamic Tool Discovery
- **Auto-detects** available AI tools across all integration types (MCP servers, VS Code extensions, CLI tools, APIs)
- **Probes actual capabilities** vs theoretical assumptions
- **Adapts in real-time** to tool availability changes

### Hybrid Integration Architecture
- **🔌 MCP Server Access** - For Claude Code, custom tools, future MCP-enabled assistants
- **🧩 VS Code Extension API** - For GitHub Copilot, Amazon Q, workspace integration
- **🌐 Direct API Calls** - For services without MCP or extension interfaces
- **💻 CLI Integration** - For command-line tools like Gemini CLI

### Adaptive Task Routing
- Routes tasks based on **actual tool availability and performance**
- Provides **graceful degradation** when preferred tools are unavailable
- Learns from **user preferences and feedback**

## 🔍 Key Features

### True Tool Agnosticism
- Works with **any combination** of AI tools
- No hardcoded assumptions about which tools are available
- **Future-proof** against new tools and integration methods

### Intelligent Orchestration
- **Right AI for the right task** through capability matching
- **Parallel execution** where possible for performance
- **Conflict resolution** for overlapping capabilities
- **Real-time adaptation** to tool health and availability

### Seamless User Experience
- **Single interface** for multiple AI tools
- **Transparent operations** with clear explanations
- **User control** with override capabilities at any level
- **Minimal configuration** required

## 🛠️ Current Status

This repository contains:

- ✅ **Complete Architecture Design** - Detailed in `ai-orchestration-mockup.qmd`
- ✅ **Proof-of-Concept Extension** - Basic VS Code extension that demonstrates GitHub Copilot API access
- 🚧 **Implementation Roadmap** - Detailed implementation plan

## 🚀 Getting Started

### View the Architecture
Open `ai-orchestration-mockup.qmd` in any Quarto-compatible viewer or convert to HTML:

```bash
# If you have Quarto installed
quarto render ai-orchestration-mockup.qmd

# Or view the raw markdown for full details
```

### Test the Copilot Integration
```bash
cd test-copilot-extension
npm install
npm run compile

# Then load the extension in VS Code for testing
```
